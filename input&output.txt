1.Hello World

This is the very first program in the programming language.,
this file contains the declaration of print function. print is used to display the message
as well as the value on the standard output device (monitor), use of print function is very easy,
you have to just pass the string (message) that you want to print on the screen within inverted 
commas ("message")

code:
print("Hello World")

Input:

output:
Hello World



2.Hello World with tab

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the python  programming 
language, you have to use \t escape sequence in order to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in
 the output console. Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the 
inverted commas ("mes\tsage").

Code:
print("hello world \t hello world")

Input:


Output:
Hello World    Hello World



3.Hello World with new line

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in programming language, 
you have to use \n escape sequence in order to provide a new line between words in the output console.
 Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\nsage").


Code:
print("hello world\nhello world")

Input:

Output:
hello world
hello world




4.Integer Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions
for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input(). Write a program to get an integer as input and print it. 
The input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters an integer, it is stored in
variable test Integer. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Code:
a = int(input())
print(a)

Input:
5

Output:
5



5.Float Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions
for I/O (Input/Output) are print and input(). Write a program to get float as input and print it. The input()
function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a float, it is stored in variable test Float.
Use '%.2f' in the print() to display float value with 2 precisions. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest
are output statements.


Code:

a = float(input())
print('%.2f'%a)

Input :

56.2425

Output :

56.24



6.Character Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for
 I/O (Input/Output) are print and input().. Write a program to get a character as input and print it. The input() 
function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in variable test 
Character. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.


Code:

a = input()
print(a)


Input:

z

Output:

z




7.String Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for
I/O (Input/Output) are print() and input(). Write a program to get the string as input and print it. The input() 
function reads formatted input from the keyboard.


Code:

a = input()
print(a)  

Input :

Programmer

Output :

Programmer




8.Ascii-I

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Write a program to get a character as input and print
it's ASCII value. When a character is entered, the character itself  stored.  And when we displayed that value using
"int()"  type casting , the entered character is displayed as Ascii value. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and
rest are output statements.


Code:

a = input()
asc = ord(a)
print(asc)

Input :

g

Output:

103




9.Ascii-II

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Write a program to get a number(ASCII) as input and print
 its equivalent character. You can display a character if you know ASCII code of that character.


Code:

 a = int(input())
print(chr(a))

Input:

103

Output:

g
